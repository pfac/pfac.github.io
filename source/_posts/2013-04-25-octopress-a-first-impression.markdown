### Why today

Today I decided I would start my Octopress blog, "finally". Like so many others, I have been postponing it since I can remember (a common thing among devs it seems). And, after years of failed attempts, from [Blogger](www.blogger.com) to [Wordpress](wordpress.com), I finally went for [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).

### Why Octopress

The text visible in the Octopress website, starting from the top: _Octopress, a blogging framework for hackers_. The only way this could appeal more to me is if it were presented by a hot naked busty woman instead of an yellow octopus.

The thing that nagged me the most in Blogger and Wordpress was the need to login and spend time with writing, formatting the text and then publishing it. And I had to wait for pages to reload. And it seemed stupid.

The same does not happen with Octopress. At the moment, I'm in Sublime Text, writing and formatting at the same time thanks to Markdown, spell checking on-the-fly thanks to Hunspell, and at any moment I can just close my laptop, go somewhere, and resume this just by opening the lid (I really did that, oh I'm so happy).

All things taken into account, this really seems the best option for a guy like me. I wonder for how long...

### Lastly a little story

It's my last day in training: I'm training to be a trainer (ah, recursion in life) and I just spent the last hour fighting Octopress, instead of watching the last simulation of my class mates.

*Why?*, you ask.

Just because. I decided I wanted to use [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) but ended up using the default Markdown.

*Why?* you ask, yet again.

Because I don't like closing tags in ERB, and since Slim does the same as Haml with less writing, it seemed perfect. But it wasn't. It wasn't because I wanted to quote why the lucky stiff. And for that I decided I would use Twitter Bootstrap.

*Why???*, you keep asking (god you're annoying).

Because it's pretty, and I like pretty. And since it has support for pretty quotes, it's just what I needed. So I spent an hour figuring out the __right way__ to add it to the blog. 

*Aaaand?*, you ask impatiently, an obvious signal that reading this post is turning out to be such an interesting experience.

Wrapping up, when I was almost done, I opened the `plugins` directory. And there it was: a component just for pretty `blockquotes`. And here I was, ~~wasting~~ investing my time. Story of my life.

If now you're asking how is this relevant, it is not. I just wanted to let some steam off and use more Markdown.
