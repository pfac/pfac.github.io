<!--more-->

Several years ago (god I'm old), just after I've finished high school, I plunged into the world of PHP. My previous experience was in classes using ASP (the old one), and I did not want to keep myself locked in the Microsoft world. I already had a great respect for open-source back then.

For more than a month, I lived, breathed and ate web. I improved my understanding of HTML, XML and XHTML. I practised CSS 2.1 to the point where I was having discussions in forums to understand why IE was so much different. I created my first website (nothing worth showing), with PHP controlling everything on the background. I even learned Javascript, not much, just enough so I would never come to "fear" it.

Using PHP I implemented my own router, authentication mechanism, template language, and I didn't even know I was doing so. I _spaghetti-ed_ my way in a webapp, and faced the overwhelming feeling of losing the control over your own creation.

After that summer, I left PHP. I only dealt with it once more, in my third year of college, for an assignment where we had to create a simple webapp to manage a database (basically just CRUD). By that time, I had already spent too much time away from web development (I was more into games), and whenever the subject surfaced in a conversation my antennas where already tuned to Ruby on Rails.

In the last year and a half, I got started with Rails, I got to play with Angular, and I ended up getting a job working with Java EE right after I finished my master's.

Now the prodigal son returns. A friend has just approached me with a challenge, a simple webapp, but it will have to be done in PHP. My _spaghetti_ days are long gone, but several questions now arise:

* Am I able to relearn a language that I've come to consider so inferior?
* Can I translate my (short) Rails knowledge to Laravel, Symfony or Yii?
* Do I even need a framework, or can I just adapt Drupal like so many have before?

And like everything in life, the time to make a decision is very limited...
